        <p>I changed the background colour,as seen in the Git message then I checked the Web page, the text was there but the colour had not changed.</br>I added a line break to start this paragraph.</br>I checked the Web page after I entered my Git message and the colour had changed.</p>
        <p>I restarted the computer signed into Git through my Google account, then downloaded the file to my Desktop and then opened it in VScode. All is fine now that I realize that Wordwrap was not on and I did not see some of the paragraph, and thought something was wrong.HAHA</p>
        <p>I'am going to shut everything down, turn the computer off then start up Google and sign into my Git account, then open this back up here in Visual Studio Code.</br>Wish me luck.</p>
        <p>This is working very good. I feel like I should make a video on this for this project.</p>
        <p>I'm going to be writting in short paragraphs to make moving them around easier?.</p>
